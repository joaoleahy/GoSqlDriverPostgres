## Go SQL Driver for PostgreSQL
This is a Go SQL Driver for connecting to PostgreSQL database.

Development Environment
Go version: 1.15 or higher

PostgreSQL database

Github.com/lib/pq driver
## Installation
You can install the github.com/lib/pq driver using the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/lib/pq
```

## Usage
To use the Go SQL Driver for PostgreSQL, you need to import the driver into your Go code:

```bash
import _ "github.com/lib/pq"
```

Next, you need to create a database connection by calling the sql.Open function with the database driver name "postgres" and a database connection string:

```bash 
db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "user=postgres password=yourpassword dbname=mydb sslmode=disable")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer db.Close()
```
After you have established a database connection, you can execute SQL queries and perform database operations.

For example, to query all data from a user_table table:

```bash 
rows, err := db.Query("SELECT user_id, name, age, phone FROM public.user_table")
if err != nil {
	return nil, err
}
defer rows.Close()
```

## Error handling
It is recommended to handle errors in your code by using the error return value. The error message will provide you with more information on what went wrong.

## Conclusion
By using the Go SQL Driver for PostgreSQL, you can interact with your PostgreSQL database in your Go applications. With its simple API, you can perform database operations with ease.
